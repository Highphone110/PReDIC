# Maddie's Branch - DO NOT TRY TO MERGE
A place where she uploads varius images and testing scripts as evidence that she was actually doing things for the project

## Final uploads file:

### Vis_script.py
Outputs the deformations for a given image set. Used for visualy inspecting deformations. Useful for trying to debug the python require code and for comparing matlab and python outputs. Hopefully gets used as an add on for the main program!


### Jiggle_maker.py:
Responsible for making "rigid body deformations" for any deformations as entered directly into the script. It also calculates the ground truths for these deformations and exports them to a csv file and uses some of the visualiser functions to save images as references. The output of the refrence image and deformed images are turned into a gif which jiggles (hence jiggle maker).
